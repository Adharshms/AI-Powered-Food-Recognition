# 🍽️ AI-Powered Food Recognition

Welcome to the **AI-Powered Food Recognition** project! This application uses computer vision and machine learning to recognize food items from images. Whether you're building a smart calorie tracker, a kitchen assistant, or just curious about what's on your plate, this project offers a foundation for real-world food detection.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 **Image-based Food Recognition**  
  Upload an image and let the model detect and classify food items.

- 🤖 **AI/ML Powered**  
  Built using deep learning techniques with high accuracy on food datasets.

- 🖼️ **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Simple UI for uploading images and viewing results.

- 🌐 **Web App Integration**  
  Deployed with a web frontend (React/Streamlit/Flask - depending on your setup).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React / Streamlit *(depending on implementation)*
- **Backend**: Flask / FastAPI
- **Model**: TensorFlow / PyTorch (custom-trained CNN or pre-trained model like EfficientNet)
- **Other**: OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Adharshms/AI-Powered-Food-Recognition.git
cd AI-Powered-Food-Recognition

# (Optional) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
````

*Note: Instructions may vary depending on your backend (Flask/FastAPI) and frontend.*

## 🔍 Example

Upload an image like:

![food sample]([https://example.com/sample-image.jpg](https://storage.googleapis.com/labellerr-cdn/CLIP_Animal_Inf/Screenshot%202023-10-05%20120403.webp))

Output:

```
🍕 Predicted: Pizza
🔥 Confidence: 92.4%
```
